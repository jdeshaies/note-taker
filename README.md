# Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this application is to be able to write and save notes in order to keep track of ideas and tasks that need to be completed. Since the code for the front end of the application was already in place, the backend had to be developed to route the GET and POST methods to add and retrieve notes from the JSON database file by using Express.js. The GET method was also used to display the main index file for the user and bring them to the notes page when they click "Get Started." Lastly, this application uses a UUID package to randomly generate an ID for each note that is used to retrieve a specific note.
